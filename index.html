                    <p>
                        Hello! I am a aspiring software developer who has many passions and talents. I love technology
                        and love learning about many different things. I have a ton of experience working with computers,
                        as I have built many computers and used to work in a electronics retail store, and want to learn
                        how to get better at the software side of computers, like coding.
                        <br></br>
                        I like to spend my free time playing video games, playing golf, playing instruments, and learning
                        about different topics on YouTube. I used to play the Tuba in High School and I was
                        apart of my High School marching band. I even went to college to play the Tuba, but that fell through
                        after Covid, and so I switched to Computer Science.
